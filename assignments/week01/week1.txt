Hi @everyone 
Only if you are comfortable with git and github, and have nodejs/npm installed you can run tests automatically by going to the code on this branch - https://github.com/100xDevs-hkirat/Week-1-assignment/tree/hkirat/with-tests

If you dont understand what's said above, please dont worry and please continue the assignment as you were



Hi @everyone , if you cant navigate to the right branch above you can use this alternate link to see the assignment with tests - https://github.com/100xDevs-hkirat/Week-1-assignment-with-tests

Again, if you don't know git/dont have node/nvm on your machine DONT DO THIS ASSIGNMENT, instead do this one - https://github.com/100xDevs-hkirat/Week-1-assignment

Both are essentially the same, but the first one has automated tests that you can run locally.
